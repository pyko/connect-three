connect three
=============
After spending too many hours playing [2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/), I decided to spend my weekend creating my own twist of the game.

So, introducing... 'Conenct Three'

It is still a prototype, though the main gist of the game is there and it's playable. Hope you enjoy it!

Time permitting, I will be porting it over to the Android platform.

The code isn't the nicest, and there is still quite a bit of polishing needed, so pull requests etc welcome!
